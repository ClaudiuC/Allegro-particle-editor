Built in 2009 using C++ and the game library Allegro 4.2.2, now deprecated.

While old and not compatible with newer versions of Allegro, it makes for a great learning resource, code heavily commented throughout and quite a nifty tool for game developers. Would love to see someone forking it and taking it to the next level.
